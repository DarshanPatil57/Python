# Getting Started with Python

## Basic Syntax
```python
# This is a comment in Python
print("Hello world")  # This displays text on the screen
```

## Functions
Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.

```python
# Define a function
def value(n):
    print(n)

# Call the function
value(5)  # This will print: 5
```

## Basic Structure
Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks. Notice how the code inside the function is indented.

```python
def example():
    # This code belongs to the function
    print("Inside function")
# This code is outside the function
```

## Running Python Code
Save your code in a file with a `.py` extension, then run it using:
```
python filename.py
```

## Comments
Use `#` to write comments in your code. Comments are ignored by Python and help document your code.

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a 
multi-line comment
"""
```
